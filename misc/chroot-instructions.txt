This works on my end with compatible devices.
Now test if this will work with your non-compatible device.
Once proven this works, I can see about adding this to the 
install-image-linux-aarch64.sh script.  

Actually, this will be a good lesson to learn if you haven't
used arch-chroot before.  

make sure you have the latest scripts from here in their own directory
https://github.com/pudges-place/exper

after the install-image-linux-aarch64.sh scipt finishes and
gives you the prompt back manually type in the following commands.

$ pacman -Q arch-install-scripts   (this provides arch-chroot)
$ sudo pacman -S arch-install-scripts   (install if necessary)
$ mkdir MP1
$ lsblk -f       (to provide device names such as /dev/sda)
$ sudo mount /dev/sda2 MP1
$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 MP1/boot
$ su           (enter your root password)
# arch-chroot MP1
# ls /home   (if chroot is successful, should show alarm as user)
# pacman-key --init
# pacman-key --populate archlinuxarm
# pacman -Syy
# pacman -R --noconfirm linux-aarch64 uboot-raspberrypi
# pacman -S --noconfirm --needed linux-rpi raspberrypi-bootloader raspberrypi-firmware
# exit    (exit from arch-chroot)
# ls /home   (should show your normal user)
# rm -rf MP1/etc/pacman.d/gnupg
# unmount MP1/boot
# unmount MP1
# exit       (exit from root back to user)
$ rm -rf MP1

Should be back to the directory where you started.
ls -l should show files as when you started.

using gnome-disks umount the uSD card
RPi 4b should boot up properly ?????

At this point, hopefully it has been proved this patch
works for the newest RPi 4b and RPi 400.

If you want to go to the next script, switch-kernel.sh 
(I guess we need to change the script name now)
You will have to comment out line 111
and change 112 so it looks like this:

# pacman -R --noconfirm linux-aarch64 uboot-raspberrypi
pacman -Syu --noconfirm --needed git libnewt wget networkmanager base-devel

If you want to complete the image by running create-image.sh
at the end of the script, look at the pathname that
bsdtar uses and that you have a similar directory tree 

Hoping for the best
